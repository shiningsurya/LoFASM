# LoFASM Station Model

Contents at this level are used to model the antenna's response to an incident electric field.

This antenna's response will then be used to model the whole lofasm station's antenna response.

`nec_generator.sh` creates `NEC` job file given frequency, polarization and loading.

`nec_executor.sh` executes the above created `NEC` jobs in parallel using `GNU Parallel`.

`nec_parser.py` parses the output csv file and takes `theta, phi, magnitude, and phase`.

`lofasm_nec.py` makes use of the csv files generated by `nec_parser.py` (and not the ones generated by `NEC`) and models the entire `lofasm` station. 
`lofasm_nec.py` simply defines a class interfacing the underling csv and the pattern function.

`lofasm_beampattern.py` reads above generated csv files and outputs beampatterns in station's horizon coordinates.
These beampatterns are given in `lofasm_bp`.

N.B. These beam patterns are generated for two-ring six-elements each LoFASM station architecture.
